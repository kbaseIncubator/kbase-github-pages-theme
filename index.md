## Getting started

### Dependencies

*KBase Github Pages Theme* is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. KBase Github Pages Theme requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

### Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add *KBase Github Pages Theme* to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)

```yaml
remote_theme: kbase/just-the-docs
```

<small>You must have GitHub Pages enabled on your repo, one or more Markdown files, and a `_config.yml` file. [See an example repository](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-docs)</small>

### Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

1. Install the Ruby Gem

```bash
$ gem install kbase-github-pages-theme
```

```yaml
# .. or add it to your your Jekyll site’s Gemfile
gem "kbase-github-pages-theme"
```

2. Add KBase Github Pages Theme to your Jekyll site’s `_config.yml`

```yaml
remote_theme: kbaseIncubator/kbase-github-pages-theme
```

3. _Optional:_ Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)

```bash
$ bundle exec kbase-github-pages-theme rake search:init
```

3. Run your local Jekyll server

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.
