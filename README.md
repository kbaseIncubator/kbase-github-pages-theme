# KBase Github Pages Theme

> Based on the [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/), this is a Github Pages (Jekyll) theme featuring responsive design, hierarchical sidebar navigation, search, and other lesser features.

## Usage

This theme is designed to be used with Github Pages for KBase  Documentation at the repository level. Of course, anyone may use it, but at their own risk since we can't promise to respond to bug reports or feature requests.

## Github Pages Installation

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: kbase-github-pages-theme
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install kbase-github-pages-theme
```

## Development

[View the documentation](https://kbase.github.io/kbase-github-pages-theme) for development and detailed usage information.

### Quick Start

Development of this theme is "development by dogfooding". The documentation for this theme is itself generated by Jekyll, so you can simply:

- get Ruby set up; e.g.

  ```sh
  rbenv init
  rbenv local 3.0.1
  ```
  
  will set you up with Ruby 3.0.1 in the local directory
  
- Install the 

  ```sh
  bundle install
  ```
  
- Start the server with the dev config override:

  ```sh
   bundle exec jekyll serve --config=_config.yml,_dev_config.yml
  ```
  
  This starts the jekyll server for the documentation, using the theme, running on localhost rather than the canonical home url.
  
-  edit the config, content, and styles

  The server will automatically rebuild the site. Just refresh the browser to see the changes.

## Contributing

As stated above, at present this theme is designed for internal KBase usage. We don't have the capacity to entertain third party contributions through Pull Requests, nor to respond to bug reports or feature requests.
